IODEFV2 Library Overview
========================

The IODEFV2 Library is a framework to manipulate IODEFV2 objects. You can
create, update and print IODEFV2 objects. It used to make sensor
developers' life better by providing features used by every sensor.

The IODEFV2 object is described in RFC 5070: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5070.txt

To update a value, you have to use the IODEFV2 Paths, inpired by
libPrelude paths.

The print functions allow you to export IODEFV2 as :
- pretty print stdout
- JSON string
- Binary string, inspired by libPrelude implementation

For transport dedicated to IODEFV2 objects, we will soon release a
framework to do that.

The IODEFV2 Library is inspired by libPrelude (https://www.prelude-siem.org).
